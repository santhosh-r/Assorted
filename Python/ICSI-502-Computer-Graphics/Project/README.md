# ualbany-csi502-project
Demo for study of SIFT in Image Stitching.

Code entirely based on https://github.com/HYPJUDY/panorama-image-stitching

The idea was to learn how image stitching was implemented in the above project while converting the code to Python using OpenCV

I also referenced https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/01/11/opencv-panorama-stitching/
